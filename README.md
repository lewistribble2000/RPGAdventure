# RPG Adventure
RPG Adventure is a work in progress RPG game developed in Unity, it is currently an unfinished project with more being added to it when I can fit in the 
development time around my scedule. The things currently implemented are, Models for player and enemy, navmesh and AI for enemy units, ray casting for attacks, 
animations for player and enemys and more.

Code is being constantly refactored however I believe in scaffolding the code to make it work and then when it's done, refactoring it to make improvements after I 
know the main parts are functional, so some parts will be better written than others
